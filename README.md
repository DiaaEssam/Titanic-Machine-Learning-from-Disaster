# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster <br />
&emsp;<strong>This project is about predicting if someone in the Titanic Disaster will survive or not.<strong/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;List of what I have done:<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1- I have described the data i got from kaggle.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2- I have visualized the relations between dependent variable and independent variables.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3- I have shown the percentage of men and Women who survived.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4- I have done feature selection.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5- I have done data preprocessing.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;6- I have done Feature Scaling.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;7- I have applied Kernel PCA.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;8- I have used various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Kernel SVM, &emsp; and etc.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;9- The best accuracy i got was 0.816 from Logistic Regression model.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10- I got 0.76 accuracy in kaggle Leaderboard.<br />
