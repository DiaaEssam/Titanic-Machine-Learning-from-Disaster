&emsp;<strong>This project is about predicting if passenger in the Titanic Disaster will survive or not.<strong/><br/>
&emsp;&emsp;List of what I have done:<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1- I have described the data I got from Kaggle.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2- I have visualized the relations between dependent variable and independent variables.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3- I have shown the percentage of men and women who survived.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4- I have done feature selection.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;5- I have done data preprocessing.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;6- I have done Feature Scaling.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;7- I have applied Kernel PCA.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;8- I have used K-Fold Cross Validation.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;9- I have used various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Kernel &nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp; SVM,etc.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;10- The best accuracy I got is 0.836 from the Kernel SVM model.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;11- I got 0.782 accuracy on Kaggle Leaderboard.<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;12- I'm in top 18% in this competition.<br/>
